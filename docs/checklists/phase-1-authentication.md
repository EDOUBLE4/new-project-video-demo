## Checklist

[ ] FRONTEND: Create a dedicated auth layout (app/auth/layout.tsx) for the authentication flow.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Add a sign-up page (app/auth/signup/page.tsx) and a login page (app/auth/login/page.tsx).  
[ ] FRONTEND: Use Shadcn/UI form components and Tailwind styling for inputs, errors, success states, neon accents.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Implement client-side validation (email format, password length) and loading states.  
[ ] FRONTEND: On successful sign-up/login, redirect user to main interface (app/(root)/page.tsx).  
[ ] FRONTEND: If user is authenticated, hide or disable sign-up/login links.  
[ ] BACKEND: Initialize Supabase client in lib/supabase/client.ts with environment variables.  
[ ] BACKEND: Configure authentication in supabase/auth.ts, including RLS to protect user data.  
[ ] BACKEND: (Optional) Create Next.js API routes for custom auth flows, securing them with Supabase checks.  
[ ] BACKEND: Trigger verification emails (if using Supabaseâ€™s email confirmation) and handle verified vs. unverified states.  
[ ] FRONTEND: Write Jest tests for sign-up/login flows; use integration tests to confirm end-to-end behavior with Supabase.
