NOTE: This is an example of a project overview. It is not a real project.
For the sake of demonstration, this document is very sparse, to show how little you need to get started.
The more detailed your project overview is, the less gaps the AI will need to fill, and the better your docs (and your project) will be.

# Project Overview Example

Chat apps, such as Slack, are a foundational element of the modern workplace. If you work remotely, such apps are even *more* central to your work - and even if you work in-person, chat apps enable asynchronous collaboration and integration with other common tools. For a baseline reference app, consider Slack - it is the dominant tool in this space, providing excellent UX and integration with a rich ecosystem.

For the purposes of developing your application, here are the core features you should target:
- Authentication
- Real-time messaging
- Channel/DM organization
- File sharing & search
- User presence, & status
- Thread support
- Emoji reactions
