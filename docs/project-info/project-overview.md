# Project Overview

Chat apps, such as Slack, are a foundational element of the modern workplace. If you work remotely, they are the workplace - and even if you work in-person, chat apps enable asynchronous collaboration and integration with other common tools. For a baseline reference app, consider Slack - it is the dominant tool in this space, providing excellent UX and integration with a rich ecosystem.

For the purposes of developing ChatGenius, here are the core features you should target:
- Authentication
- Real-time messaging
- Channel/DM organization
- File sharing & search
- User presence, & status
- Thread support
- Emoji reactions
