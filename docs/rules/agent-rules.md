This is an AI-first codebase. It needs to be modular, scalable, and easy to understand. The file structure should be highly navigable, and the code should be well-organized and easy to read.

All files should have an explanation of their contents at the top, and all functions should have proper commentation of their purpose and parameters (JSDoc, TSDoc, etc, whatever is appropriate).
To maintain readability by Cursor's AI tools, files should not exceed 250 lines.
