## Technical Implementation Plan

### Data Sources
- **Primary Data**: COI documents (PDFs, images) uploaded by users
- **External APIs**: Dun & Bradstreet (business verification), OSHA (safety records)
- **User-Generated**: Requirements templates, vendor contacts, compliance notes
- **Real-time vs Batch**: Real-time processing for COIs, batch for predictions

### Key Integrations Needed
1. **Vectorize.io**: Core AI infrastructure for document processing and knowledge
2. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Natural language generation for instructions and analysis
3. **Supabase**: Database, auth, storage, and real-time subscriptions
4. **Resend**: Transactional email for vendor communications
5. **Vercel**: Hosting, edge functions, and cron jobs

### Database Schema Requirements
- **Core Entities**: vendors, certificates, requirements, compliance_events, predictions
- **Time-series**: compliance_history for trend analysis and ML training
- **Analytics**: aggregated_metrics for dashboards and reporting
- **Vector Storage**: Built into Vectorize for insurance knowledge RAG
- **Audit/Logging**: Complete event trail for SOC2 compliance

### AI Cost Estimates
- **Expected Monthly Usage**: 10,000 COI processes + 50,000 Q&A queries
- **Primary Models**: Vectorize IRIS ($0.10/doc), Vectorize RAG ($0.05/query), GPT-4 ($0.03/1K tokens)
- **Cost Budget**: $3,000/month at scale (covered by $300/customer at 10+ customers)
- **Optimization Strategy**: Cache common queries, use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, batch processing

## User Experience Design

### User Types
1. **Property Managers**: Need quick compliance status and vendor communication
2. **Compliance Officers**: Require detailed analytics and audit reports
3. **Vendors**: Want clear requirements and simple upload process

### Core User Flows
1. **COI Upload & Analysis**: Upload → AI Processing → Gap Report → Send Instructions → Track Resolution
2. **Compliance Monitoring**: Dashboard → Filter Non-Compliant → Bulk Actions → Track Progress
3. **Vendor Self-Service**: Receive Link → View Requirements → Upload COI → Get Instant Feedback

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Design Style**: Clean, professional SaaS with insurance industry credibility
- **Key Components**: Drag-drop uploader, compliance dashboard, vendor portal, chat interface
- **Mobile Requirements**: Fully responsive, camera upload for mobile COIs
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, screen reader support

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Manual COI review takes 15-30 minutes per document
