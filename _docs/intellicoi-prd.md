# Agentic-First Product Requirements Document (PRD) - IntelliCOI Platform

## Document Purpose
This PRD captures the complete product vision, requirements, and success criteria for IntelliCOI Platform. It serves as the source of truth for all product decisions.

## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
IntelliCOI transforms vendor insurance compliance from a 70% failure rate to 95% success through AI-powered automation that not only identifies coverage gaps but provides specific, actionable instructions to fix them, reducing manual effort by 80% while eliminating liability exposure for property management companies.
