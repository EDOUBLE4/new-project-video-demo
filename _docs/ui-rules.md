# UI Design Rules

This document outlines the visual and interaction design guidelines for the AI property management agent. We are adopting a **Minimalist** design philosophy to ensure the interface is clean, intuitive, and focused.

## Core Principles

-   **Clarity First:** The user should always understand what is happening and what to do next. Avoid ambiguity.
-   **Simplicity:** Eliminate any non-essential elements. Every element on the screen should serve a clear purpose.
-   **Consistency:** All components (buttons, inputs, spacing, etc.) must be consistent in appearance and behavior across the entire application.
-   **Feedback:** The system must provide clear and immediate feedback for user actions (e.g., sending a message, loading results).

## Layout and Spacing

-   **White Space:** Use generous white space to create a clean, uncluttered layout and improve readability.
-   **Alignment:** All elements should be aligned on a consistent grid. Left-alignment should be used for text to ensure readability.
-   **Chat Interface:** The primary interface will be a chat window. User messages will be aligned to the right, and agent messages to the left.

## Component Behavior

-   **Buttons:** Buttons should have clear states: default, hover, and disabled. They should use a solid color for primary actions and a more subtle style for secondary actions.
-   **Input Fields:** The text input for the chat should be clearly defined and have a visible focus state when active.
-   **Loading Indicators:** When the agent is processing a request or searching for apartments, a subtle loading indicator (e.g., a spinner or pulsing dots) must be displayed.
-   **Responsiveness:** The application must be fully responsive and usable on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops. A mobile-first approach should be taken during development.
