## Core Functionality

The AI agent will be able to:

-   Search for available apartments based on user-specified criteria:
    -   **Size:** (e.g., studio, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom)
    -   **Location:** (e.g., city, state, zip code)
    -   **Price Range:** (e.g., $1000-$1500/month)
-   Provide users with a list of available apartments that match their search.
-   Display relevant details for each available apartment (e.g., rent, amenities, photos).

## Ultimate Goal

To create a user-friendly and efficient AI agent that simplifies the process of finding available apartments for prospective tenants, while streamlining the leasing process for the property management company.
